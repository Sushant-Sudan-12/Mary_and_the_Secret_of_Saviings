Im trying to make a game adaptation of a children's book called "Mary and the Secret of savings"

The idea of creating this book came from the Lisbon Hub of the Global Shapers Community in 
the midst of the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the biggest global economic contraction since the Great Depression.
The unprecedented impact this crisis has had on economic activity has exacerbated existing 
gaps between individuals, businesses and states.
Above all, this crisis exposed how unprepared many individuals and organizations are to face a 
shock of this magnitude. This book therefore aims to help strengthen our societies by developing financial practices that will allow citizens to better face future structural challenges.
Now with similar objectives to the book, Im making a top down RPG, because video games are as good as a medium to spread message as any other electronic medium.
