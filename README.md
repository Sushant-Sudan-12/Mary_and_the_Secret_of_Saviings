I have created a small environment of a top down rpg

In this there are three kind of interactions that can happen one at a time

One is cutscene talking where we have to listen to the monolgue of the NPC character

The other is where we are buying movie ticket its a simple yes and no

The last one is the bargaining system in which we can bargain for a lower range I did not put a way to input cost insread i have put ranges as option

TO INTERACT WITH A CHARCHTER GO NEAR IT AND PRESS "E"

Sometimes we can instead of English a weird language Im looking into it, its a problem with the font and I will see what I can do 



Im trying to make a game adaptation of a children's book called "Mary and the Secret of savings"

The idea of creating this book came from the Lisbon Hub of the Global Shapers Community in 
the midst of the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the biggest global economic contraction since the Great Depression.
The unprecedented impact this crisis has had on economic activity has exacerbated existing 
gaps between individuals, businesses and states.
Above all, this crisis exposed how unprepared many individuals and organizations are to face a 
shock of this magnitude. This book therefore aims to help strengthen our societies by developing financial practices that will allow citizens to better face future structural challenges.
Now with similar objectives to the book, Im making a top down RPG, because video games are as good as a medium to spread message as any other electronic medium.
